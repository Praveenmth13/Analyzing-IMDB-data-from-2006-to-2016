# Analyzing-IMDB-data-from-2006-to-2016
* Data management is important because the data your organization creates is a
very valuable resource.
* The last thing you want to do is spend time and resources collecting data and
business intelligence, only to lose or misplace that information.
* In that case, you would then have to spend time and resources again to get that
same business intelligence you already had.
* And on that data analysis is carried out which show visualization of our
problems in efficient way.
* Data Analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and
modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing
conclusions, and supporting decision- making.
